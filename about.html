						<p>In 2005 I started my career on IT field working at Help-Desk providing customers support, which led me to becoming a trainee at IBM providing Mainframe applications support in 2007.</p>
		
						<p>One year later I was hired as an employee at IBM to work on the at&t project still using the Mainframe environment. I was able to identify and develop two web applications to increase the speed and effectiveness of metrics and also have greater control over access to all employees.</p>
							
						<p>In the middle of 2012, I started at Shell Brazil as a Second Level Application Support where I was responsible to develop new features and support around 55 applications by fixing bugs through Change Process and providing technical solutions to the most variable problems and issues.</p>
							
						<p>By the end of 2015, I went back to the at&t project where I began working as an Application Developer with Microsoft solutions and others technologies.</p>
							
						<p>Since then, I am focusing on developing my career as Web Developer, studying for certifications, and always pushing my self to study and be at the top of new technologies.</p>
